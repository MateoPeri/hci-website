    <h1>About</h1>

    There are some design patterns used in this website!
    Let's take a look at them!!

    <h2>Navbar</h2>
    <p>
        At the top of the page you may observe what is commonly known as a "navbar" (short for navigation bar).
        It is used to give users a quick and intuitive way to navigate the site, while always keeping the important links at hand.
    </p>

    <h2>Carousel</h2>
    <p>
        If you head over to <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> you will see many pictures with two arrows on either side.
        These form what's called a "carousel", a revolving display of pictures.
        These allow for many images to be in the same space, so they don't clutter the view.
        Also, the user is not forced to view these images, they have the option to cycle through them.
    </p>

    <h2>Module tabs</h2>
    <p>
        You are reading about module tabs... in a module tab!1!! This element allows for compartimentalization of space and 
        organizes elements more efficiently.
